# Broken-Engine
A game engine written in C# using OpenGL.

## This game engine is NOT actually broken! :)
But it has a very creative name.
Please note that this is only a test / side project, which is still in development.
The purpose of this project is, to learn how to write a game engine.
This game engine is written in C# using the OpenGL bindings and math classes from OpenTK.

## Building
Just clone the repo and hit "run" in Visual Studio.

## Dependencies
- OpenTK (OpenGL)
- ImGui (UI)
- NLog (Logging)

This project uses Nuget, which means that all dependencies should be automaticlly downloaded by Visual Studio.
