# Broken-Engine
My attempt to write a 3D game engine with PBR / PBS in OpenGL and C#

## This game engine is NOT actually broken! :)
But it has a very creative name.
Please note that this is only a test / side project to see if I am able to make it.
If you want to see how I implemented everything take a look at the source.
To run, just clone and open it with Visual Studio.

## Dependencies:
- OpenTK
- Gwen.NET

Requires OpenGL > 4.2
